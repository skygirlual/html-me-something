<h1>&#8608;So many things!</h1>
<div>If this page is about me, then I'll have to stop and ask myself "Who am I?" which is usually followed by "What am I doing?" and hopefully I know the answers to at least one of those questions! &#9829;</div>

  <h1>Talk Baseball to me!</h1>
  <p>Scratch that, let's talk <a href="https://www.mlb.com/royals">Royals!</a> I grew up in KC and it was a pretty big deal for our family to go to the games! My dad wasn't the kind of guy to get excited about sports, so it made a big impression when he ran outside cheering after the 1985 World Series win! We've cheered on the Royals all these years, win or lose! </p>

  <h1>Speaking of Family...</h1>
  <p>Kids are great. I highly recommend having some if you have time and energy! Experiencing life with my child has been my favorite part of this journey so far! I've found that I enjoy my favorite things more when I'm with my little family.</p>
  <p>Good times together include:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>concerts</li>
        <li> escape rooms</li>
        <li>traveling</li>
        <li> photography</li>
        <li>and even coding! </li></ul>

  <h1>Take me far away!</h1>
  <p>... just be sure I get a return ticket. I LOVE to travel. I love to experience new cultures and see who lives on the other side of the world. People are so interesting, and everyone has a story. I think most people are like that, which is probably why "Humans of New York" is so popular.</p><p> I've been to some pretty cool places, some I've been lucky enough to have stayed a while like Paris and Johannesburg.<p>
